### Structure of the Site
The proposed website is primarily meant to drive users to download the app. To serve this purpose, it is a one-page vertical scroll website with a focus on highlighting application features, offering the opportunity to subscribe to updates and sending visitors to their perspective app store.

At any time, the viewer can return to the top of the page by clicking the logo in the top left of the screen, on the navBar. Because the navBar follows the user down the page, it is very easy and quick to navigate to the varying sections of the site.
